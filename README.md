# RETROFIT LIBRARY IN ANDROID
The Retrofit library is a type-safe REST client for Android, Java, and Kotlin, developed by Square. With the help of the Retrofit library, we can have access to a powerful framework that helps us in authenticating and interacting with APIs and sending network requests with OkHttp. With the help of this library, downloading JSON or XML data from a web API becomes easy. In a Retrofit library, once the data is downloaded, it is parsed into a Plain Old Java Object (POJO) which must be defined for each “resource” in the response. Retrofit is an easy and fast library to retrieve and upload data via a REST-based web service.

Retrofit manages the process of receiving, sending, and creating HTTP requests and responses. It resolves issues before sending an error and crashing the application. It pools connections to reduce latency. It is used to cache responses to avoid sending duplicate requests
